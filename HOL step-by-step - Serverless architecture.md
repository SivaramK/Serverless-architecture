# Serverless architecture hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hand-on lab, you will be challenged to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, Event Grid, and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, workflows, and monitoring, using various components of Microsoft Azure. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

At the end of the hands-on-lab, you will have confidence in designing, developing, and monitoring a serverless solution that is resilient, scalable, and cost-effective.

## Overview

Contoso Ltd. is rapidly expanding their toll booth management business to operate in a much larger area. As this is not their primary business, which is online payment services, they are struggling with scaling up to meet the upcoming demand to extract license plate information from a large number of new tollbooths, using photos of vehicles uploaded to cloud storage. Currently, they have a manual process where they send batches of photos to a 3rd-party who manually transcodes the license plates to CSV files that they send back to Contoso to upload to their online processing system. They want to automate this process in a way that is cost effective and scalable. They believe serverless is the best route for them, but do not have the expertise to build the solution.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![The Solution diagram is described in the text following this diagram.](../Whiteboard%20design%20session/media/preferred-solution.png 'Solution diagram')

The solution begins with vehicle photos being uploaded to an Azure Storage blobs container, as they are captured. An Event Grid subscription is created against the Blob storage create event, calling the photo processing **Azure Function** endpoint (on the side of the diagram), which in turn sends the photo to the **Cognitive Services Computer Vision API OCR** service to extract the license plate data. If processing was successful and the license plate number was returned, the function submits a new Event Grid event, along with the data, to an Event Grid topic with an event type called "savePlateData". However, if the processing was unsuccessful, the function submits an Event Grid event to the topic with an event type called "queuePlateForManualCheckup". Two separate functions are configured to trigger when new events are added to the Event Grid topic, each filtering on a specific event type, both saving the relevant data to the appropriate **Azure Cosmos DB** collection for the outcome, using the Cosmos DB output binding. A **Logic App** that runs on a 15-minute interval executes an Azure Function via its HTTP trigger, which is responsible for obtaining new license plate data from Cosmos DB and exporting it to a new CSV file saved to Blob storage. If no new license plate records are found to export, the Logic App sends an email notification to the Customer Service department via their Office 365 subscription. **Application Insights** is used to monitor all of the Azure Functions in real-time as data is being processed through the serverless architecture. This real-time monitoring allows you to observe dynamic scaling first-hand and configure alerts when certain events take place. **Azure Key Vault** is used to securely store secrets, such as connection strings and access keys. Key Vault is accessed by the Function Apps through an access policy within Key Vault, assigned to each Function App's system-assigned managed identity.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription (non-Microsoft subscription).
- Local machine or a virtual machine configured with (**complete the day before the lab!**):
  - Visual Studio Community 2019 or greater.
    - <https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/>
  - Azure development workload for Visual Studio.
    - <https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-vs#prerequisites>
  - .NET Framework 4.7 runtime (or higher) and .NET Core 2.1 SDK (or higher).
    - <https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows>
- Office 365 account. If required, you can sign up for an Office 365 trial at:
  - <https://portal.office.com/Signup/MainSignup15.aspx?Dap=False&QuoteId=79a957e9-ad59-4d82-b787-a46955934171&ali=1>
- GitHub account. You can create a free account at <https://github.com>.

## Exercise 1: Azure data, storage, and serverless environment setup

**Duration**: 30 minutes

You must provision a few resources in Azure before you start developing the solution. Ensure all resources use the same resource group for easier cleanup.

In this exercise, you will provision a blob storage account using the Hot tier, and create two containers within to store uploaded photos and exported CSV files. You will then provision two Function Apps instances, one you will deploy from Visual Studio, and the other you will manage using the Azure portal. Next, you will create a new Event Grid topic. After that, you will create an Azure Cosmos DB account with two collections. Finally, you will provision a new Cognitive Services Computer Vision API service for applying object character recognition (OCR) on the license plates.

    |                          |                                                                                                                                                             |
    | ------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
    | **Name**      |                                                                          **Value**                                                                          |
    | computerVisionApiKey     |                                                                   Computer Vision API key                                                                   |
    | eventGridTopicKey        |                                                                 Event Grid Topic access key                                                                 |
    | cosmosDBAuthorizationKey |                                                                    Cosmos DB Primary Key                                                                    |
    | blobStorageConnection    |                                                               Blob storage connection string                                                                |

    When you are finished creating the secrets, your list should look similar to the following:

    ![The listing of secrets is displayed matching the previously defined values.](media/key-vault-keys.png "Key Vault Secrets")

### Task 7: Retrieve the URI for each secret

When you set the App Settings for the Function App in the next section below, you will need to reference the URI of a secret in Key Vault, including the version number. To do this, perform the following steps for each secret and **copy the values** to Notepad or similar text application.

1. Open your Key Vault instance in the portal.

2. Select **Secrets** under Settings in the left-hand menu.

3. Select the secret whose URI value you wish to obtain.

4. Select the **Current Version** of the secret.

    ![The secret's current version is selected.](media/key-vault-secret-current-version.png "Current Version")

5. Copy the **Secret Identifier**.

    ![The Secret Identifier field is highlighted. Next to this field is a copy button.](media/key-vault-secret-identifier.png "Secret Identifier")

    When you add the Key Vault reference to this secret within a Function App's App Settings, you will use the following format: `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri={referenceString})`, where `{referenceString}` is replaced by the Secret Identifier (URI) value above. **Be sure to remove the curly braces (`{}`)**.

    For example, a complete reference would look like the following:

    `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://tollboothvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/blobStorageConnection/d6ea0e39236348539dc33565e031afc3)`

When you are done creating the values, you should have a list similar to the following:

```text
@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://tollboothvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/blobStorageConnection/771aa40adac64af0b2aefbd741bd46ef)
@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://tollboothvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/computerVisionApiKey/ce228a43f40140dd8a9ffb9a25d042ee)
@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://tollboothvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/cosmosDBAuthorizationKey/1f9a0d16ad22409b85970b3c794a218c)
@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://tollboothvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/eventGridTopicKey/e310bcd71a72489f89b6112234fed815)
```

## Exercise 2: Develop and publish the photo processing and data export functions

**Duration**: 45 minutes

Use Visual Studio and its integrated Azure Functions tooling to develop and debug the functions locally, and then publish them to Azure. The starter project solution, TollBooths, contains most of the code needed. You will add in the missing code before deploying to Azure.

### Task 1: Configure application settings

In this task, you will apply application settings using the Microsoft Azure Portal.

1. Using a new tab or instance of your browser navigate to the Azure portal, <http://portal.azure.com>.

2. Open the **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group, and then select the Azure Function App you created whose name ends with **FunctionApp**. This is the one you created using the **.NET Core** runtime stack. If you did not use this naming convention, that's fine. Just be sure to make note of the name so you can distinguish it from the Function App you will be developing using the portal later on.

    ![In the ServerlessArchitecture resource group, the TollBoothFunctionApp is selected.](media/image33.png 'ServerlessArchitecture resource group')

3. Select **Configuration** on the Overview pane.

    ![In the TollBoothFunctionApp blade on the Overview tab, under Configured features, the Configuration item is selected.](media/image34.png 'TollBoothFunctionApp blade')

4. Scroll to the **Application settings** section. Use the **+ New application setting** link to create the following additional Key/Value pairs (the key names must exactly match those found in the table below). **Be sure to remove the curly braces (`{}`)**.

    |                          |                                                                                                                                                             |

    ![In the Application Settings section, the previously defined key / value pairs are displayed.](media/application-settings.png 'Application Settings section')

5. Select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot of the Save icon.](media/image36.png 'Save icon')

### Task 2: Create a system-assigned managed identity for your Function App to connect to Key Vault

In order for your Function App to be able to access Key Vault to read the secrets, you must [create a system-assigned managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity#adding-a-system-assigned-identity) for the Function App, and [create an access policy in Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-secure-your-key-vault#key-vault-access-policies) for the application identity.

1. Open the Azure Function App you created whose name ends with **FunctionApp** and navigate to **Platform features**.

2. Select **Identity**.

3. Within the **System assigned** tab, switch **Status** to **On**. Select **Save**.

    ![In the Identity blade, the System assigned tab is selected with the Status set to On and the Save button is highlighted.](media/function-app-identity.png "Identity")

### Task 3: Add Function App to Key Vault access policy

Perform these steps to create an access policy that enables the "Get" secret permission:

1. Open your Key Vault service.

2. Select **Access policies**.

3. Select **+ Add Access Policy**.

    ![In the Key vault Access Policies blade, The Add Access Policy link is highlighted.](media/key-vault-add-access-policy.png "Access policies")

4. Select the **Select principal** section on the Add access policy form.

    ![In the Add access policy form, the Select principal field is highlighted.](media/key-vault-add-access-policy-select-principal.png "Add access policy")

5. In the Principal blade, search for your TollBoothFunctionApp Function App's service principal, select it, then select the **Select** button.

    ![In the Select a principal form, TollBooth is entered into the search field and the Function App's principal is selected in the search results. The Select button is also highlighted.](media/key-vault-principal.png "Principal")

6. Expand the **Secret permissions** and check **Get** under Secret Management Operations.

    ![In the Add access policy form, the Secret Permissions dropdown is expanded with the Get checkbox checked.](media/key-vault-get-secret-policy.png "Add access policy")

7. Select **Add** to add the new access policy.

8. When you are done, you should have an access policy for the Function App's managed identity. Select **Save** to finish the process.

    ![In the list of Key Vault access policies, the policy that was just created is highlighted. The Save button is selected to commit the changes.](media/key-vault-access-policies.png "Access policies")

### Task 4: Finish the ProcessImage function

There are a few components within the starter project that must be completed, marked as TODO in the code. The first set of TODO items we will address are in the ProcessImage function, the FindLicensePlateText class that calls the Computer Vision API, and finally the SendToEventGrid.cs class, which is responsible for sending processing results to the Event Grid topic you created earlier.

> **Note:** Do **NOT** update the version of any NuGet package. This solution is built to function with the NuGet package versions currently defined within. Updating these packages to newer versions could cause unexpected results.

1. Navigate to the **TollBooth** project (`C:\ServerlessMCW\MCW-Serverless-architecture-master\hands-on-lab\starter\TollBooth\TollBooth.sln`) using the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio.

2. From the Visual Studio **View** menu, select **Task List**.

    ![The Visual Studio Menu displays, with View and Task List selected.](media/vs-task-list-link.png 'Visual Studio Menu')

3. There you will see a list of TODO tasks, where each task represents one line of code that needs to be completed.

    ![A list of TODO tasks, including their description, project, file, and line number are displayed.](media/vs-task-list.png 'TODO tasks')

4. Open **ProcessImage.cs**. Notice that the Run method is decorated with the FunctionName attribute, which sets the name of the Azure Function to "ProcessImage". This is triggered by HTTP requests sent to it from the Event Grid service. You tell Event Grid that you want to get these notifications at your function's URL by creating an event subscription, which you will do in a later task, in which you subscribe to blob-created events. The function's trigger watches for new blobs being added to the images container of the storage account that was created in Exercise 1. The data passed to the function from the Event Grid notification includes the URL of the blob. That URL is in turn passed to the input binding to obtain the uploaded image from Blob storage.

5. The following code represents the completed task in ProcessImage.cs:

    ```csharp
    // **TODO 1: Set the licensePlateText value by awaiting a new FindLicensePlateText.GetLicensePlate method.**

    licensePlateText = await new FindLicensePlateText(log, _client).GetLicensePlate(licensePlateImage);
    ```

6. Open **FindLicensePlateText.cs**. This class is responsible for contacting the Computer Vision API to find and extract the license plate text from the photo, using OCR. Notice that this class also shows how you can implement a resilience pattern using [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly), an open source .NET library that helps you handle transient errors. This is useful for ensuring that you do not overload downstream services, in this case, the Computer Vision API. This will be demonstrated later on when visualizing the Function's scalability.

7. The following code represents the completed task in FindLicensePlateText.cs:

    ```csharp
    // TODO 2: Populate the below two variables with the correct AppSettings properties.
    var uriBase = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("computerVisionApiUrl");
    var apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("computerVisionApiKey");
    ```

8. Open **SendToEventGrid.cs**. This class is responsible for sending an Event to the Event Grid topic, including the event type and license plate data. Event listeners will use the event type to filter and act on the events they need to process. Make note of the event types defined here (the first parameter passed into the Send method), as they will be used later on when creating new functions in the second Function App you provisioned earlier.

9. The following code represents the completed tasks in `SendToEventGrid.cs`:

    ```csharp
    // TODO 3: Modify send method to include the proper eventType name value for saving plate data.
    await Send("savePlateData", "TollBooth/CustomerService", data);

    // TODO 4: Modify send method to include the proper eventType name value for queuing plate for manual review.
    await Send("queuePlateForManualCheckup", "TollBooth/CustomerService", data);
    ```

    > **Note**: TODOs 5, 6, and 7 will be completed in later steps of the guide.

### Task 5: Publish the Function App from Visual Studio

In this task, you will publish the Function App from the starter project in Visual Studio to the existing Function App you provisioned in Azure.

1. Navigate to the **TollBooth** project using the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio.

2. Right-click the **TollBooth** project and select **Publish** from the context menu.

    ![In Solution Explorer, the TollBooth is selected, and within its context menu, the Publish item is selected.](media/image39.png 'Solution Explorer ')

3. In the Pick a publish target window, make sure **Azure Functions Consumption Plan** is selected, choose the **Select Existing** radio button, **uncheck** the **Run from package file (recommended)** checkbox, then select **Create Profile**.

    ![In the Pick a publish target window, the Azure Functions Consumption Plan is selected in the left pane. In the right pane, the Select Existing radio button is selected and the Run from package file (recommended) checkbox is unchecked. The Create Profile button is also selected.](media/vs-publish-function.png 'Publish window')

    > **Note**: If you do not see the ability to publish to an Azure Function, you may need to update your Visual Studio instance.

    > **Note**: We do not want to run from a package file, because when we deploy from GitHub later on, the build process will be skipped if the Function App is configured for a zip deployment.

4. In the App Service form, select your **Subscription**, select **Resource Group** under **View**, then expand your **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group and select the Function App whose name ends with **FunctionApp**.

5. Whatever you named the Function App when you provisioned it is fine. Just make sure it is the same one to which you applied the Application Settings in Task 1 of this exercise.

    ![In the App Service form, Resource Group displays in the View field, and in the tree-view below, the ServerlessArchitecture folder is expanded, and TollBoothFunctionApp is selected.](media/image41.png 'App Service form')

6. After you select the Function App, select **OK**.

    > **Note**: If prompted to update the functions version on Azure, select **Yes**.

7. Select **Publish** to start the process. Watch the Output window in Visual Studio as the Function App publishes. When it is finished, you should see a message that says, `========== Publish: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 skipped ==========`.

8. Using a new tab or instance of your browser navigate to the Azure portal, <http://portal.azure.com>.

9. Open the **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group, then select the Azure Function App to which you just published.

10. Expand the functions underneath your Function App in the menu. You should see both functions you just published from the Visual Studio solution listed.

    ![In the Function Apps blade, in the left tree-view both TollBoothFunctionApp, and Functions (Read Only) are expanded. Beneath Functions (Read Only), two functions ExportLicensePlates and ProcessImage are highlighted.](media/image42.png 'TollBoothFunctionApp blade')

11. Now we need to add an Event Grid subscription to the ProcessImage function, so the function is triggered when new images are added to blob storage. Select the **ProcessImage** function, then select **Add Event Grid subscription**.

    ![In the TollboothFunctionApp tree-view, the ProcessImage function is selected. In the code window pane, the Add Event Grid subscription link is highlighted.](media/processimage-add-eg-sub.png 'ProcessImage function')

12. On the **Create Event Subscription** blade, specify the following configuration options:

    a. **Name**: Unique value for the App name similar to **processimagesub** (ensure the green check mark appears).

    b. **Event Schema**: Select Event Grid Schema.

    c. For **Topic Type**, select **Storage Accounts**.

    d. Select your **subscription** and **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group.

    e. For resource, select your recently created storage account.

    f. Select only the **Blob Created** from the event types dropdown list.

    g. Leave Azure Function as the Endpoint Type.

13. Leave the remaining fields at their default values and select **Create**.

    ![In the Create event subscription form, the fields are set to the previously defined values.](media/processimage-eg-sub.png)

## Exercise 3: Create functions in the portal

**Duration**: 45 minutes

Create two new Azure Functions written in Node.js, using the Azure portal. These will be triggered by Event Grid and output to Azure Cosmos DB to save the results of license plate processing done by the ProcessImage function.

    c. Select the same **Location** as your Resource Group region.

    ![Fields in the Application Insights blade are set to the previously defined settings.](media/application-insights-form.png 'Application Insights blade')

5. Select **Review + Create**, then choose **Create**.

### Task 2: Enable Application Insights integration in your Function Apps

Both of the Function Apps need to be updated with the Application Insights instrumentation key so they can start sending telemetry to your new instance.

1. After the Application Insights account has completed provisioning, open the instance by opening the **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group, and then selecting the your recently created application insights instance.

2. Copy the **Instrumentation Key** from the Essentials section of the **Overview** blade.

    > **Note**: You may need to expand the **Essentials** section.

    ![In Application Insights blade, Overview is selected in the left-hand menu. In the right pane, the copy button next to the Instrumentation Key is selected.](media/app-insights-key.png 'TollBoothMonitor blade')

3. Open the Azure Function App you created whose name ends with **FunctionApp**, or the name you specified for the Function App containing the ProcessImage function.

4. Select **Configuration** on the **Overview** pane.

5. Scroll down to the **Application settings** section. Use the **+ Add new setting** link and name the new setting **APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY**. Paste the copied instrumentation key into its value field.

6. Select **OK**.

7. Select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot of the Save icon.](media/image36.png 'Save icon')

8. Follow the steps above to add the APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY setting to the function app that ends in **Events**.

### Task 3: Use the Live Metrics Stream to monitor functions in real time

Now that Application Insights has been integrated into your Function Apps, you can use the Live Metrics Stream to see the functions' telemetry in real time.

1. Open the Azure Function App you created whose name ends with **FunctionApp**, or the name you specified for the Function App containing the ProcessImage function.

2. Select **Application Insights** on the Overview pane.

    > **Note**: It may take a few minutes for this link to display. Try refreshing the page after a few moments.

    ![In the TollBoothFunctionApp blade, under Configured features, the Application Insights link is selected.](media/image64.png 'TollBoothFunctionApp blade')

3. In Application Insights, select **Live Metrics Stream** underneath Investigate in the menu.

    ![In the TollBoothMonitor blade, in the pane under Investigate, Live Metrics Stream is selected. ](media/image65.png 'TollBoothMonitor blade')

4. Leave the Live Metrics Stream open and go back to the starter app solution in Visual Studio.

5. Navigate to the **UploadImages** project using the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio. Right-click on **UploadImages**, then select **Properties**.

    ![In Solution Explorer, the UploadImages project is expanded, and Properties is selected from the right-click context menu.](media/vs-uploadimages.png 'Solution Explorer')

6. Select **Debug** in the left-hand menu, then paste the connection string for your Blob storage account into the **Command line arguments** text field. This will ensure that the required connection string is added as an argument each time you run the application. Additionally, the combination of adding the value here and the `.gitignore` file included in the project directory will prevent the sensitive connection string from being added to your source code repository in a later step.

    ![The Debug menu item and the command line arguments text field are highlighted.](media/vs-command-line-arguments.png "Properties - Debug")

7. Save your changes.

8. Right-click the **UploadImages** project in the Solution Explorer, then select **Debug** then **Start new instance** from the context menu.

    ![In Solution Explorer, the UploadImages project is selected. From the context menu, Debug then Start new instance is selected.](media/vs-debug-uploadimages.png 'Solution Explorer')

9. When the console window appears, enter **1** and press **ENTER**. This uploads a handful of car photos to the images container of your Blob storage account.

    ![A Command prompt window displays, showing images being uploaded.](media/image69.png 'Command prompt window')

10. Switch back to your browser window with the Live Metrics Stream still open within Application Insights. You should start seeing new telemetry arrive, showing the number of servers online, the incoming request rate, CPU process amount, etc. You can select some of the sample telemetry in the list to the side to view output data.

    ![The Live Metrics Stream window displays information for the two online servers. Displaying line and point graphs including incoming requests, outgoing requests, and overall health. To the side is a list of Sample Telemetry information. ](media/image70.png 'Live Metrics Stream window')

11. Leave the Live Metrics Stream window open once again, and close the console window for the image upload. Debug the UploadImages project again, then enter **2** and press **ENTER**. This will upload 1,000 new photos.

    ![The Command prompt window displays with image uploading information.](media/image71.png 'Command prompt window')

12. Switch back to the Live Metrics Stream window and observe the activity as the photos are uploaded. It is possible that the process will run so efficiently that no more than two servers will be allocated at a time. You should also notice things such as a steady cadence for the Request Rate monitor, the Request Duration hovering below \~500ms second, and the Process CPU percentage roughly matching the Request Rate.

    ![In the Live Metrics Stream window, two servers are online. Under Incoming Requests. the Request Rate heartbeat line graph is selected, as is the Request Duration dot graph. Under Overall Health, the Process CPU heartbeat line graph is also selected, the similarities between this graph and the Request Rate graph under Incoming Requests are highlighted for comparison.](media/image72.png 'Live Metrics Stream window ')

13. After this has run for a while, close the image upload console window once again, but leave the Live Metrics Stream window open.

### Task 4: Observe your functions dynamically scaling when resource-constrained

In this task, you will change the Computer Vision API to the Free tier. This will limit the number of requests to the OCR service to 10 per minute. Once changed, run the UploadImages console app to upload 1,000 images again. The resiliency policy programmed into the FindLicensePlateText.MakeOCRRequest method of the ProcessImage function will begin exponentially backing off requests to the Computer Vision API, allowing it to recover and lift the rate limit. This intentional delay will greatly increase the function's response time, thus causing the Consumption plan's dynamic scaling to kick in, allocating several more servers. You will watch all of this happen in real time using the Live Metrics Stream view.

1. Open your Computer Vision API service by opening the **ServerlessArchitecture** resource group, and then selecting the **Cognitive Services** service name.

2. Select **Pricing tier** under Resource Management in the menu. Select the **F0 Free** pricing tier, then choose **Select**.

    > **Note**: If you already have an **F0** free pricing tier instance, you will not be able to create another one.

    ![In the Cognitive Services blade, under Resource Management, the Pricing tier item is selected. In the Choose your pricing tier blade, the F0 Free option is selected.](media/image73.png 'Choose your pricing tier blade')

3. Switch to Visual Studio, debug the **UploadImages** project again, then enter **2** and press **ENTER**. This will upload 1,000 new photos.

    ![The Command prompt window displays image uploading information.](media/image71.png 'Command Prompt window')

4. Switch back to the Live Metrics Stream window and observe the activity as the photos are uploaded. After running for a couple of minutes, you should start to notice a few things. The Request Duration will start to increase over time. As this happens, you should notice more servers being brought online. Each time a server is brought online, you should see a message in the Sample Telemetry stating that it is "Generating 2 job function(s)", followed by a Starting Host message. You should also see messages logged by the resilience policy that the Computer Vision API server is throttling the requests. This is known by the response codes sent back from the service (429). A sample message is "Computer Vision API server is throttling our requests. Automatically delaying for 32000ms".

    > **Note**: If you do not see data flow after a short period, consider restarting the Function App.

    ![In the Live Metrics Stream window, 11 servers are now online.](media/image74.png 'Live Metrics Stream window ')

5. After this has run for some time, close the UploadImages console to stop uploading photos.

6. Navigate back to the **Computer Vision** API and set the pricing tier back to **S1 Standard**.

## Exercise 5: Explore your data in Azure Cosmos DB

**Duration**: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will use the Azure Cosmos DB Data Explorer in the portal to view saved license plate data.

    ![In the tree-view beneath the LicencePlates Cosmos DB, the Processed collection is selected. From its right-click context menu, New SQL Query is selected.](media/data-explorer-new-sql-query.png 'Tollbooth - Data Explorer blade')

8. Modify the SQL query to count the number of processed documents that have not been exported:

    ```sql
    SELECT VALUE COUNT(1) FROM c WHERE c.exported = false
    ```

9. Execute the query and observe the results. In our case, we have 669 processed documents that need to be exported.

    ![In the Query window, the previously defined SQL query displays. Under Results, the number 669 is highlighted.](media/cosmos-query-results.png 'Query 1 tab')

## Exercise 6: Create the data export workflow

    > **Note**: This evaluates the status code returned from the ExportLicensePlates function, which will return a 200 code when license plates are found and exported. Otherwise, it sends a 204 (NoContent) status code when no license plates were discovered that need to be exported. We will conditionally send an email if any response other than 200 is returned.

    ![The first Condition field displays Status code. The second, drop-down menu field displays is equal to, and the third field is set to 200.](media/logicapp-condition.png 'Condition fields')

14. We will ignore the If true condition because we don't want to perform an action if the license plates are successfully exported. Select **Add an action** within the **If false** condition block.

    ![Under the Conditions field is an If true (green checkmark) section, and an if false (red x) section. In the If false section, the Add an action button is selected.](media/logicapp-condition-false-add.png 'Logic App Designer Condition fields if true/false ')

15. Enter **Send an email** in the filter box, then select the **Send an email (V2)** action for Office 365 Outlook.

    ![In the Choose an action box, send an email is entered as the search term. From the Actions list, Office 365 Outlook (end an email (V2) item is selected.](media/logicapp-send-email.png 'Office 365 Outlook Actions list')

16. Select **Sign in** and sign into your Office 365 Outlook account.

    ![In the Office 365 Outlook - Send an email box, the Sign in button is selected.](media/image93.png 'Office 365 Outlook Sign in prompt')

17. In the Send an email form, provide the following values:

    a. Enter your email address in the **To** box.

    b. Provide a **Subject**, such as **Toll Booth license plate export failed**.

    c. Enter a message into the **Body**, and select the **Status code** from the ExportLicensePlates function so that it is added to the email body.

    ![In the Send an email box, fields are set to the previously defined values.](media/logicapp-send-email-form.png 'Logic App Designer , Send an email fields')

18. Select **Save** in the tool bar to save your Logic App.

19. Select **Run** to execute the Logic App. You should start receiving email alerts because the license plate data is not being exported. This is because we need to finish making changes to the ExportLicensePlates function so that it can extract the license plate data from Azure Cosmos DB, generate the CSV file, and upload it to Blob storage.

    ![The Run button is selected on the Logic Apps Designer blade toolbar.](media/logicapp-start.png 'Logic Apps Designer blade')

20. While in the Logic Apps Designer, you will see the run result of each step of your workflow. A green checkmark is placed next to each step that successfully executed, showing the execution time to complete. This can be used to see how each step is working, and you can select the executed step and see the raw output.

    ![In the Logic App Designer, green check marks display next to Recurrence, ExportLicensePlates, Condition, and Send an email steps of the logic app.](media/image96.png 'Logic App Designer ')

21. The Logic App will continue to run in the background, executing every 15 minutes (or whichever interval you set) until you disable it. To disable the app, go to the **Overview** blade for the Logic App and select the **Disable** button on the taskbar.

    ![The Disable button is selected on the TollBoothLogic Logic app blade toolbar menu.](media/image97.png 'TollBoothLogic blade')

## Exercise 7: Configure continuous deployment for your Function App

    ![The Deployment Center tab is shown with a pending build.](media/functionapp-dc.png 'Function App Deployment Center')

### Task 3: Finish your ExportLicensePlates function code and push changes to GitHub to trigger deployment

1. Navigate to the **TollBooth** project using the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio.

2. From the Visual Studio **View** menu, select **Task List**.

    ![Task List is selected from the Visual Studio View menu.](media/image37.png 'Visual Studio View menu')

3. There you will see a list of TODO tasks, where each task represents one line of code that needs to be completed.

4. Open **DatabaseMethods.cs**.

5. The following code represents the completed task in DatabaseMethods.cs:

    ```csharp
        // TODO 5: Retrieve a List of LicensePlateDataDocument objects from the collectionLink where the exported value is false.
        licensePlates = _client.CreateDocumentQuery<LicensePlateDataDocument>(collectionLink,
                new FeedOptions() { EnableCrossPartitionQuery=true,MaxItemCount = 100 })
            .Where(l => l.exported == false)
            .ToList();
        // TODO 6: Remove the line below.
    ```

6. Make sure that you deleted the following line under TODO 6: `licensePlates = new List<LicensePlateDataDocument>();`.

7. Save your changes then open **FileMethods.cs**.

8. The following code represents the completed task in DatabaseMethods.cs:

    ```csharp
    // TODO 7: Asyncronously upload the blob from the memory stream.
    await blob.UploadFromStreamAsync(stream);
    ```

9. Save your changes.

10. Right-click the **TollBooth** project in Solution Explorer, then select **Commit...** under the **Source Control** menu item.

13. Select the **Sync** button on the **Synchronization** step.

    ![Under Synchronization in the Team Explorer - Synchronization window, the Sync link is selected.](media/image111.png 'Team Explorer - Synchronization window')

    Afterward, you should see a message stating that the incoming and outgoing commits were successfully synchronized.

14. Go back to Deployment Center for your Function App in the portal. You should see an entry for the deployment kicked off by this last commit. Check the timestamp on the message to verify that you are looking at the latest one. **Make sure the deployment completes before continuing**.

    ![The latest deployment is displayed in the Deployment Center.](media/functionapp-dc-latest.png 'Deployment Center')

## Exercise 8: Rerun the workflow and verify data export

**Duration**: 10 minutes

With the latest code changes in place, run your Logic App and verify that the files are successfully exported.

### Task 1: Run the Logic App

1. Open your ServerlessArchitecture resource group in the Azure portal, then select your Logic App.

2. From the **Overview** blade, select **Enable**.

    ![In the TollBoothLogic Logic app blade, Overview is selected in the left menu, and the Enable enable button is selected in the right pane.](media/image113.png 'TollBoothLogic blade')

3. Now select **Run Trigger**, then select **Recurrence** to immediately execute your workflow.

    ![In the TollBoothLogic Logic app blade, Run Trigger and Recurrence are selected.](media/image114.png 'TollBoothLogic blade')

4. Select the **Refresh** button next to the Run Trigger button to refresh your run history. Select the latest run history item. If the expression result for the condition is **true**, then that means the CSV file should've been exported to Blob storage. Be sure to disable the Logic App so it doesn't keep sending you emails every 15 minutes. Please note that it may take longer than expected to start running, in some cases.

    ![In Logic App Designer, in the Condition section, under Inputs, true is highlighted.](media/image115.png 'Logic App Designer ')

### Task 2: View the exported CSV file

1. Open your ServerlessArchitecture resource group in the Azure portal, then select your **Storage account** you had provisioned to store uploaded photos and exported CSV files.

2. In the Overview pane of your storage account, select **Containers**.

    ![In the Overview blade, Containers is selected.](media/storage-containers.png 'Services section')

3. Select the **export** container.

    ![Export is selected under Name.](media/image117.png 'Export option')

4. You should see at least one recently uploaded CSV file. Select the filename to view its properties.

    ![In the Export blade, under Name, a .csv file is selected.](media/blob-export.png 'Export blade')

5. Select **Download** in the blob properties window.

    ![In the Blob properties blade, the Download button is selected.](media/blob-download.png 'Blob properties blade')

    The CSV file should look similar to the following:

    ![A CSV file displays with the following columns: FileName, LicensePlateText, TimeStamp, and LicensePlateFound.](media/csv.png 'CSV file')

6. The ExportLicensePlates function updates all of the records it exported by setting the exported value to true. This makes sure that only new records since the last export are included in the next one. Verify this by re-executing the script in Azure Cosmos DB that counts the number of documents in the Processed collection where exported is false. It should return 0 unless you've subsequently uploaded new photos.

## After the hands-on lab

**Duration**: 10 minutes

In this exercise, attendees will deprovision any Azure resources that were created in support of the lab.

### Task 1: Delete the resource group in which you placed your Azure resources

1. From the Portal, navigate to the blade of your **Resource Group** and select **Delete** in the command bar at the top.

2. Confirm the deletion by re-typing the **resource group name** and selecting **Delete**.

3. If you created a different resource group for your virtual machined, be sure to delete that as well.

4. Optionally, delete the GitHub repository you created for this lab by selecting **settings** and then **Delete this repository** from the GitHub website.

### Task 2: Delete the GitHub repo

1. Open <https://www.github.com>, then select your profile icon and select **Your repositories**.

2. Navigate to your repo and select it.

3. Select the **Settings** tab, scroll to the bottom, select **Delete this repository**.

You should follow all steps provided _after_ attending the Hands-on lab.
